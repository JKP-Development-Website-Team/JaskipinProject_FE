## Git Workflow
1. Before writing any code please do like following
```bash
git pull origin main
```

to make sure there is no updates in `Github` repository.

2. After that, change your branch and name it like following
``git checkout -b (your_features)-(your_name)``

3. And that push your updated code to branch development
```bash
git push origin development
```
